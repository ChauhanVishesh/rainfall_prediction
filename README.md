RAINFALL PREDICTION USING LOGISTIC REGRESSION
This project uses logistic regression to predict the likelihood of rainfall based on historical weather data. The implementation employs Python libraries such as pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, and scikit-learn for data preprocessing, visualization, and model development.
The objective of this project is to predict whether it will rain based on weather-related features such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and pressure. Logistic regression is used as the predictive modeling technique for this binary classification problem.
